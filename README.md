# Genetic drift in expansions with density-dependent dispersal and growth

Code and scripts to generate and analyze data for 1D reaction-diffusion equations with density-dependent diffusion.

## Prerequisites

Code was written and executed using the following packages:

Python 2.7.14
Python 3.7.3
Numpy 1.4.2
Matplotlib 2.2.2
C++ compiler (e.g. g++)

Not guaranteed to work with other versions.
